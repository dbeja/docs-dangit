# docs_dangit: A search engine for WordPress developers

[CLOUDFEST 2023 HACKATHON PROJECT](https://www.cloudfest.com/a-search-engine-for-wordpress-developers)

Introducing “docs_dangit”, a search engine specifically designed for WordPress developers. With docs_dangit you can easily find the code examples you need from a variety of official documentation sources, all in one place. Simply enter a keyword or phrase, and docs_dangit will return a list of relevant code examples; be it PHP code or WP-CLI command. Plus, with advanced filtering options, you can narrow down your search results to find exactly what you’re looking for.

## Hackathon Goals

The only problem with this search engine is that it doesn’t exist.

Yet.

Let’s build it together, starting with Code reference and WP-CLI handbooks, and make the world a little bit better. Name is open for voting (e.g. add_love, remove_pain etc).
